+ Architecture Options:
	- ResNet (made by us), ResNet50, EfficientNetB7, Custom made CNN.

+  Optimizers:
	- SGD, momentum, RMSProp, adam, (Newton's method).

+ Data Augmentation --> Rotations mainly, etc.

+ Apply Batch Normalization.

+ Apply Transfer learning, dropouts.

+ Obtain saliency maps + images with prediction/true.

+ Discussion --> How we trained, are there patterns in wrongly classified images? how to improve?
